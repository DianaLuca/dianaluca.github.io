	<h1>Hi!</h1>
	<br>
	<p>&emsp;I have enjoyed solving math and physics problems since I was a child.
		Right now, analyzing and gaining insights from big sets of data makes me even more excited about technology,
		fuels my curiosities, and allows me to be an explorer and a lifelong learner.
	</p>

	<p>&emsp;My career started in telecom, as a Trainee Engineer at T-Mobile Romania,
		then progressed through Testing and Quality Assurance Automation at Ceragon Networks and ING Bank Services, where I started to gain programming skills,
		and finally discovered that Data Science suits me best. </p>

	<p>&emsp;I have developed my knowledge in algorithms and data structures
		by solving more than 300 algorithmic problems and participating in 20 contests on the Leetcode platform.</p>

	<p>&emsp;My first data science project was as a volunteer for USR, a people union who aims to improve the Romanian society
		by working on social, cultural, and political projects. I did statistical analysis
		to help USR develop more targeted advertising and marketing communication material.<a href="../projects">- more about projects</a> </p>

	<p>&emsp;Continued the transition into data science by analyzing real-world data sets obtained from trusted sources like
		Wikipedia, United States Census Bureau, Zillow, The National Centers for Environmental Information, finance.yahoo.com and quandl.com

	<p>Worked at:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>ING Services (automation "HomeBank" user product)</li>
		<li>eZuce (testing openUC open source product)</li>
		<li>Ceragon Networks (regression and automation on Ceragon's proprietary hardware and software)</li>
		<li>Telekom Romania (intern, testing networking solutions for B2B clients)</li>
	</ul>

	<p></p>

	<p>&emsp;I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University Politehnica of Bucharest,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.old.upb.ro/en/faculty-of-electronics-telecommunications-and-information-technology.html"> Faculty of Electronics Telecommunications
