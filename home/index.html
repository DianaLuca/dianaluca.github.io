	<h1>Hi!</h1>
	<br>
	<p>&emsp;I enjoyed solving math and physics problems since I was a kid. Later on, the computer becomes my first attraction in spending time.
		Right now, analyzing and gaining insights from big sets of data makes me even more excited about technology,
		fuels my curiosities, and allows me being an explorer and a lifelong learner.
	</p>

	<p>&emsp;I have developed my knowledge in algorithms and data structures
		by solving more than 300 algorithmic problems and participating in 20 contests on Leetcode platform.</p>

		<p>&emsp;My first data science project was as a  volunteer for USR, a people union who aims to improve the Romanian society
			by working on social, cultural, and political projects. I did statistical analysis
			to help USR develop a more targeted advertising and marketing communication material <a rel="shortcut icon" href="../projects"> - more about projects</a> </p>

		<p>&emsp;I continued my transition into data science by analyzing real-world data sets obtained from trusted sources like
			Wikipedia, United States Census Bureau, Zillow, The National Centers for Environmental Information, finance.yahoo.com and quandl.com

		<p>&emsp;My career started in telecom, as a Trainee Engineer at T-Mobile Romania,
			then progressed through Testing and Quality Assurance Automation at Ceragon Networks and ING Bank Services, where I started to gain programming skills,
			and finally discovered that Data Science suits me best. </p>

			<p>Worked at:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ING Services (automation "HomeBank" user product)</li>
				<li>eZuce (testing openUC open source product)</li>
				<li>Ceragon Networks (regression and automation on Ceragon's proprietary hardware and software)</li>
				<li>Telekom Romania (intern, testing networking solutions for B2B clients)</li>
			</ul>

	<p>&emsp;I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University Politehnica of Bucharest,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.old.upb.ro/en/faculty-of-electronics-telecommunications-and-information-technology.html"> Faculty of Electronics Telecommunications
