    <br>

    <h2>Data scraping and data cleaning</h2>
    <p>&emsp;I have scraped Wikipedia to retrieve “All Time Olympic Games Medals” dataset, did the necessary data cleaning, and applied DataFrame methods to analyze and return data characteristics (e.g., which country has won the most gold medals).</p>
        <p>&emsp;Did similar data analysis tasks on “United States Census Bureau” dataset, which contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;•Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Numpy</p>

    <h2>Hypothesis Testing on Zillow housing data set</h2><br>
        <p>&emsp;The hypothesis asked to demonstrate that the price of houses in university towns is less affected by the recession from 2009.</p>
        <p>&emsp;To do this, I ran a T-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts (2008 quarter 2) compared to the recession bottom (2009 quarter 2). The hypothesis proved to be correct.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;•Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy</p>

    <h2>Visualization on record high and record low temperatures</h2><br>
        <p>&emsp;Created an intuitive visualization (line graph, scatter min/max points, legend, labels, no chart junk) of the record high and record low temperatures in Ann Arbor, Michigan (by day of the year over the period 2005-2014).</p>
        <p>&emsp;Data came as a raw “.csv” from The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily).</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;•Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib</p>

    <h2>Correlation among cryptocurrencies, fiat, and gold</h2>
        <p>&emsp;End to end project which aimed to show if any correlation exists or not among cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrencies and fiat, and, between cryptocurrencies and gold.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Steps:</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;- State the research question: “What is the relation between cryptocurrencies BTC, LTC, ETH, Stock Market, and Gold in the past 10 years?”</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;- Provide trusted sources for the datasets (BTC, LTC, ETH, Gold, and Stock Market currency in US Dollar) at a 1-day granularity. I used finance.yahoo.com and quandl.com.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;- Processed the data into data frames and decided to do 4 subplots, 3 simple line plots, and a matrix plot.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Having to deal with time-series data, line charts were the typical form of representation.</p>
        <p>&emsp;It was also easy to spot when prices dropped or increased, and to make a fast relative comparison between currencies.</p>
        <p>&emsp;The heated histogram was picturing a negative correlation between the US Dollar and Gold and a positive linear relationship among cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC).</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;•Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn</p>

    <h2>Volunteer at USR - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.usr.ro/">"www.usr.ro"</a></h2>
    <p>&emsp;I did statistical analysis in order to help USR develop a more targeted advertising and marketing communications material.</p>
    <p>&emsp;USR is a people union who aimed to improve the Romanian society by working on social, cultural and political projects.</p>

    <h2>Electoral turnout map for the Romanian elections - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://parlament2016.ro/">"parlament2016.ro"</a></h2>
    <p>&emsp;The main purpose of the site was to show the electoral turnout live (less than 2 minutes delay from the official government data) for the Romanian parliamentary elections which took place on the 11th of December 2016.<p>
    <p>&emsp;I pitched and prepared media kits for the electoral map such that became featured in the press and at the TV, in over 10 Romanian national level publications, like Digi24 or republica.ro.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Over 60.000 unique users accessed the website, meaning over 1% of the total Romanian voting population - and a significantly higher percentage of the internet-using population.</p>
